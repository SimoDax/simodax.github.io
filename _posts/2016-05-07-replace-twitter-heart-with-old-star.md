title: Replace the new Twitter heart with the old star
---
Have you ever felt nostalgic since when Twitter replaced the classic star for favouring tweets with the new heart-shaped like button? I made a <userstyles.org> style that brings your shiny yellow button back! You just need Firefox or Chrome with the addon Stylish installed in order to use it:

- [Get it for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/)
- [Get it for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe)

<br/>
Now install the userstyle from [here](https://userstyles.org/styles/120386/replace-twitter-heart-with-the-old-fav-star)

Enjoy!
